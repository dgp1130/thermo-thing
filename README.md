# Thermo Thing

Android Things server for Thermo project. Interfaces with [Thermo](https://github.com/dgp1130/thermo) app
to remotely control a thermostat.

This serves mainly as a didactic project to learn the Kotlin language and the Android Things framework in a complete
project setting. This is open source so others can use it for reference if needed, but I doubt anyone will really
find much use for it.
